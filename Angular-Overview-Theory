Server renders index.html as follows.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
 <base href="/">
</head>
</body>
<app-root> Story of angular starts here...</app-root>
</html>

** From <app-root></app-root> story of angular starts.

** Basic overview of angular is ::
1)In angular we have modules. By default one module is provided and it is named as app.module.ts

Basic structure of app.module.ts looks as mentioned below::

import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { TestComponent } from './test/test.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    TestComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }

NOTE:: It is kind of Main class but I need to know how boostrap property works.Since I left index.html without any 
ng tag and nothing appeared. I was expecting by default AppComponent view shall appear which did not happened. Need to check this.



2)Now in index.html we have flexibility to load any component by using the selector defined in component.

3)Inside module we have differenet components, my view is we can create as many as component for different features as per d requirement.
Since component consist of 3 parts
    3.a)test.component.ts
    3.b)test.component.html
    3.c)test.component.css
